## Research project
**Female adolescents feel more distress from stressful events than male adolescents do**
## Introduction 
- The impact of stress on non-specific psychological distress, a construct involving cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms common across various mental disorders, varies by demographic factors like sex and ethnic groups. While non-specific psychological distress is commonly measured using validated tools such as the K6 and K10 scales (Kessler et al., 2002).
- Yet, prior studies have primarily focused on adults or populations in specific geographic locations (Matud et al., 2000).
  
- Therefore, this research brings out the **Research Question**: Do stressful life events in the past year influence a male or a female adolescent‚Äôs non-specific psychological distress?
- **Exploratory Question**: Do stressful life events in the past year influence an Asian or a non-Asian adolescent‚Äôs non-specific psychological distress?

## Methods
**Participants**: 
- This study analyzed data from **732** adolescents who participated in the Research on Adaptive Interests, Skills, and Environments (RAISE) study, a longitudinal research project conducted in the U.S. from 2014 to 2019. The data for this study exclusively comes from **Wave 2** (2016‚Äì2017), during which surveys were administered online to nearly all participants (Hoyle, 2024).

**Measures**:  
- **Psychological Distress (_PSYDIST2_)**: Psychological distress was assessed using a reliable six-item scale designed to measure the severity of common emotional and cognitive symptoms, including nervousness, hopelessness, restlessness, and feelings of worthlessness. Participants were asked to rate how often they experienced these feelings over the past year. Responses were averaged to create a composite score, with higher scores reflecting greater distress. This scale showed strong reliability with a Cronbach‚Äôs alpha of 0.85.  
- **Stressful Life Events (_SLET2_)**: Stress was assessed using a checklist of 13 life events (e.g., "In the past year, did you experience a breakup of a romantic relationship you were having?‚Äù). Each event was coded as "1" if experienced in the past year and "0" otherwise. The total number of events was summed for each participant to indicate their overall stress level.  
- **Demographics**:  
_Gender_: Participants identified as either male or female.  
_Ethnic group_: Participants were grouped into two categories: Asian or Non-Asian.

**Analysis**:
A factor analysis was conducted to confirm the construct of the psychological distress scale, I examined whether the six items consistently measured the same idea. The results showed that all six items loaded onto a single factor, with loadings ranging from 0.504 to 0.854, indicating that it is a reliable measure of psychological distress. Each item's contribution was assessed, showing strong alignment with the overall construct.


## Results  
![gender](/assets/img/male:female.png)  
**_PSYDIST2_**: the mean of the non-specific Psychological distress scale, measured by six items (Hoyle, 2024).  
**_SLET2_**: the number of stressful life events experienced in the past year, a summed index of 13 binary items (Hoyle, 2024).  
**_DEMGEN2_**: Gender [0 = Male, 1 = Female]    
**_DEMRA2013_**: Ethnic groups [0 = Non-Asian, 1 = Asian]

- **_Finding 1_**: The interaction effect of stressful life events on non-specific psychological distress for both male and female adolescents is statistically significant (***p<.001).
- **_Finding 2_**: Moderation Analysis, sex significantly moderates the stress-distress relationship (***p < 0.001):
- **_Finding 3_**: Female adolescents experience a stronger impact of stressful events on psychological distress compared to male adolescents, as indicated by the steeper slope for females.  
![ethnicity](/assets/img/ethnicgroup.png)  
- **_Finding 4_**: No significant interaction effect was found for ethnicity (Asian vs. Non-Asian) on the relationship between stressful life events and psychological distress.

# Impact
This research sheds light on how stressful life events differentially affect psychological distress in adolescents based on gender. The findings are critical for understanding mental health disparities and tailoring interventions to address these differences. Specifically, the results suggest that:  
**Who it Benefits**:  
- _Educators and School Counselors_: These findings can inform the development of gender-sensitive mental health programs in schools to better support female students who are disproportionately impacted by stress.
Parents and Guardians: Understanding that females may be more vulnerable to stress can help families implement better coping strategies and support systems at home.  
- _Mental Health Professionals_: Therapists and counselors can use these insights to design personalized stress management interventions, particularly for adolescent females.  

**Application in Real-World Settings**:  
- The study's results can guide schools in prioritizing resources for mental health programs, such as workshops on stress management tailored to gender-specific needs.
Community organizations focused on adolescent well-being can use these findings to advocate for policy changes, such as increased funding for female-focused mental health initiatives.
 
**Significance and Precision**:  
- This research emphasizes the importance of addressing gender disparities in mental health without overgeneralizing the findings to other populations or contexts. While no significant moderating effect of ethnicity was found, future work should explore other demographic and contextual variables, such as socioeconomic status, to gain a more comprehensive understanding.
